# MLTryOuts

1. Started with California Housing Price analysis
   - Tried using
     - Linear Regression
     - Random Forest Regressor
     - Decision Tree Regressor
     - KMeans
     - SVR ~ svm
     - KNeighbors Regressor
   - Need to work
     - XGBoost if possible
     - ML Pipeline for the entire process
  
2. Will be working on a time series analysis
3. Will be working on Titanic Dataset no surviver predicting

## Code Snippets

- sklearn LabelEncoding
- sklearn OrdinalEncoding
- sklearn SimpleImputer
- sklearn TrainTestSplit

## ML Bascis

- Will be adding some details on the same

## To learn

- Pyspark
- Tensorflow
- OpenCV
- DS related Mathematics

## Area to fix in the Repo

- Make all Snippets code working
