- **Ensamble Models** get results by combining several models, provides better prediction performance. **XGBoost** is one such model. It uses base learner primitive Decision Tree(very small ones, called *Decision stump*) as the base model. It iteratively build one on top of stump which are not very efficient and accurate.

- **Early Stopping** choosing the step were its optimal to avoid overfilling of the data. Elbow point.
